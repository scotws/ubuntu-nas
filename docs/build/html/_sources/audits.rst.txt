Security audits
===============

We use Lynis to look for security holes. Unfortunately, Ubuntu (again) contains
an old version. The following is how get the newest version:

.. code:: bash

        dpkg -s apt-transport-https | grep -i status

Shows us that the HTTPS transport is not installed. Do this with

.. code:: bash

        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Now that we can use HTTPS we can install the program itself.

.. code:: bash

        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys C80E383C3DE9F082E01391A0366C67DE91CA5D5F
        echo "deb https://packages.cisofy.com/community/lynis/deb/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cisofy-lynis.list
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install lynis

Finally we're ready to rock:

.. code:: bash

        sudo lynis audit system | less -R

Walk through the output and figure out how to secure stuff.

.. code:: bash

        cat /var/log/lynis.log | grep Suggestion
